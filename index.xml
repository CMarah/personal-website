      <description>Show that for all primes \(p\) there is a \(n \in \N\) such that
\[2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 \equiv 0 \quad (mod \quad p)\]
---END OF GOAL---
This being a modulo problem with primes, we should keep in mind Fermat&#39;s Little Theorem:
\[p \space \text{prime}, a \in \N \Rightarrow a^p \equiv a \space (mod \space p)\]
Let&#39;s first find \(n\) for the cases \(p = 2\) and \(p = 3\).</description>

      <description>This is my personal website, made with Hugo.
Tech &amp;amp; Choices Framework When choosing a framework to build my personal website there were a few factors I took into consideration, like the kind of content I wanted to host, and its format. As this is a blog/portfolio/hub, it made sense to have a static site. I don&amp;rsquo;t need any database or server design, and I would be serving fixed HTML. The significant increase in speed is always welcome, and I wanted to minimize complexity.</description>

      <description>Find all \(x, y \in \Z_+\) and primes \(p\) such that
\[p^x + 1 = y^2\]
---END OF GOAL---
We begin by rearranging and transforming our equation:
\[ \begin{aligned} p^x + 1 &amp;= y^2 \\ p^x &amp;= y^2 - 1 \\ p^x &amp;= (y+1)(y-1) \end{aligned} \]
Therefore, we have
\[ \left.\begin{aligned} y+1&amp;=p^a, a \in \Z_+ \\ y+1&amp;=p^b, b \in \Z_+, a  b \end{aligned}\right\} \Longrightarrow (y+1)-(y-1) = p^a - p^b \Longrightarrow 2 = p^b(p^{a-b} - 1) \]</description>

      <description>For a long time this website has had a couple of links to contact me, but those days are over.
Now I have a brand new Hugo website with a custom written theme complete with
 A homepage with more social links, and description of my skills An about page with description of who I am A portfolio page to showcase all my projects A blog  Why Hugo? The first question is why a site builder?</description>
