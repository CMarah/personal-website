      <description>Find all \(x, y \in \Z_+\) and primes \(p\) such that
\[p^x + 1 = y^2\]
---END OF GOAL---
We begin by rearranging and transforming our equation:
\[ \begin{aligned} p^x + 1 &amp;= y^2 \\ p^x &amp;= y^2 - 1 \\ p^x &amp;= (y+1)(y-1) \end{aligned} \]
Therefore, we have
\[ \left.\begin{aligned} y+1&amp;=p^a, a \in \Z_+ \\ y+1&amp;=p^b, a \in \Z_+, a  b \end{aligned}\right\} \Longrightarrow (y+1)-(y-1) = p^a - p^b \Longrightarrow 2 = p^b(p^{a-b} - 1) \]</description>

      <description>I created my portfolio website using Hugo and UIKit, it serves as an online resume containing all my work.
This has been created as a theme so that others can use and adapt it.
Sections Homepage The homepage provides the basic information about you, including links to social media, skills you have, things you&amp;rsquo;ve done and your education. This page makes good use of UIKit grid and cards for organising all the information and ensuring it is responsive to work on mobile devices.</description>
