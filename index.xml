      <description>An extensible, powerful text editor can be of great use in many sites. Draft.js is a rich text editor framework for React, with some very deep customizability. Sadly, this seems to come at the cost of an API which feels cumbersome at times, and the docs are lacking. In any case, the framework is still being slowly developed and is one of the main options to consider.
I used Draft.js to add some new functionalities to basic textareas.</description>

      <description>When I set off to create a personal website, I knew I wanted it to be static. A blog should be fast &amp;amp; lightweight, and the simple logic is always a plus. Nowadays there is no shortage of static site generators, like Jekyll or Gatsby, and given my experience with JS &amp;amp; React these were some very natural options. Still, I ended up choosing Hugo, as I had read some great reviews about it, and wanted to learn something a bit different.</description>

      <description>Show that for all primes \(p\) there is a \(n \in \N\) such that
\[2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 \equiv 0 \quad (mod \quad p)\]
---END OF GOAL---
This being a modulo problem with primes, we should keep in mind Fermat&#39;s Little Theorem:
\[p \space \text{prime}, a \in \N \Rightarrow a^p \equiv a \space (mod \space p)\]
Let&#39;s first find \(n\) for the cases \(p = 2\) and \(p = 3\).</description>

      <description>This is my personal website, made with Hugo.
Tech &amp;amp; Choices Framework When choosing a framework to build my personal website there were a few factors I took into consideration, like the kind of content I wanted to host, and its format. As this is a blog/portfolio/hub, it made sense to have a static site. I don&amp;rsquo;t need any database or server design, and I would be serving fixed HTML. The significant increase in speed is always welcome, and I wanted to minimize complexity.</description>

      <description>Find all \(x, y \in \Z_+\) and primes \(p\) such that
\[p^x + 1 = y^2\]
---END OF GOAL---
We begin by rearranging and transforming our equation:
\[ \begin{aligned} p^x + 1 &amp;= y^2 \\ p^x &amp;= y^2 - 1 \\ p^x &amp;= (y+1)(y-1) \end{aligned} \]
Therefore, we have
\[ \left.\begin{aligned} y+1&amp;=p^a, a \in \Z_+ \\ y+1&amp;=p^b, b \in \Z_+, a  b \end{aligned}\right\} \Longrightarrow (y+1)-(y-1) = p^a - p^b \Longrightarrow 2 = p^b(p^{a-b} - 1) \]</description>
