    - title: JavaScript
      logo: https://res.cloudinary.com/samrobbins/image/upload/v1591793272/logos/logos_javascript_adj1dx.svg
      description: "With over 5 years of experience, JavaScript is my main
        programming Language. I try to write clean, maintainable code, while
        keeping up to date on current JS practices. In particular, I prefer
        functional programming, as I think it produces a more readable code.
      "
    - title: React
      logo: "logos/react.svg"
      description: "React has been my main UI framework for the past few years, having
        used it in several projects, both small and large in scale. Though I have tried
        other libraries, I'm still the most comfortable with React.
        This is specially true with the addition of hooks, as it becomes much more
        compatible with functional programming.<br>
        With React I've also used other technologies such as Redux or Immutable.

    - title: Docker
      logo: "logos/docker.png"
      description: "During the past few years I've ported multiple services to
        Docker containers. I needed consistent results and parallelization, as workloads
        could vary, and Docker was one of the obvious choices.<br>
        In particular, one of the projects involved web crawling, and I feared it could
        be troublesome to launch multiple containers with web browsers on a single
        machine, but it works flawlessly.
      "
    - title: MongoDB
      logo: "logos/mongodb.svg"
      description: "I have used Mongo in almost every project since I started coding.
        Easy to set up, fast if correctly indexed, and being very comfortable with it,
        I doubt I'll stop using Mongo any time soon.
      "
    - title: RabbitMQ
      logo: "logos/rabbitmq.png"
      description: "RabbitMQ has been a key part of many of my projects in recent years.
        I've often needed multiple servers or processes to communicate, like queueing up
        different kind of tasks for Docker containers to fulfill. RabbitMQ is the
        best option I've found to cover this necessity.<br>
        Decently easy to set up, reliable, open-source...
        I haven't found any reason to stop using it.

    - title: Redis
      logo: "logos/redis.svg"
      description: "I've used Redis in a couple of occasions, when response time was important
        enough, like when setting up a cache. Though not suitable for large storage sizes,
        for small & quick databases I would say it's one of my favourite options.
      "
    - title: Vue
      logo: "logos/vue.png"
      description: "Vue was my first step in frontend frameworks, and I think it was a great
        starting point. It's simplicity and ease of use made writing components very easy,
        while being more than powerful enough for many projects.<br>
        Though I wouldn't recommend it for very complex or large sites, I still use it
        sometimes if I want to release an idea quickly.

    - title: Latex
      logo: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/LaTeX_logo.svg
      description: "LaTeX is a key tool when writing mathematical content. Though a bit
        daunting at first, it's practically mandatory nowadays. In this website I'm using
        <a href='https://katex.org/'>KaTeX</a>, a math typesetting library for websites.
