      <description>This is my personal website, made with Hugo.
Tech &amp;amp; Choices Framework When choosing a framework to build my personal website there were a few factors I took into consideration, like the kind of content I wanted to host, and its format. As this is a blog/portfolio/hub, it made sense to have a static site. I don&amp;rsquo;t need any database or server design, and I would be serving fixed HTML. The significant increase in speed is always welcome, and I wanted to minimize complexity.</description>
