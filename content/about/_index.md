Hi! I'm Carlos, a Mathematician & Software Developer residing in Spain.
I was born in Seville, and at 17 I moved to Barcelona to study there. Thanks to the [CFIS
Programme](https://www.upc.edu/en/the-upc/schools/cfis), a grant which allows studying two
degrees simultaneously, I was able to further learn about two of the topics I'm most
passionate about: Mathematics & Computer Science. Once I finished, I moved to Madrid to
work there, and have remained here ever since.

Beside my job, pursuing personal projects & learning new things is very important to me.
I am always looking for interesting problems, both mathematical & coding; I would like to post some of these in the _Math_ section.

You can find my CV [_here_](/CV.pdf).
